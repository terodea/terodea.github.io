This `Pig` tutorial briefs how to `install` and `configure` Apache Pig. Apache Pig is an abstraction over MapReduce. Pig is basically a tool to easily perform analysis of larger sets of data by representing them as data flows. 

So, letâ€™s start Pig Installation on Ubuntu.

**Step 1 :-** ***Pre-Requisite to Apache Pig*** <br>
* JAVA : Install `java`,and export path variables in `.bashrc`.
* Hadoop : Install hadoop in pseudo-distribuited mode with YARN as resource manager.

**Step 2 :-** ***Download PIG*** <br>
* You can download latest version of Pig from here [Download](https://pig.apache.org/releases.html).
* Click `Download a release now.`

**Step 3 :-** ***Extract Apache PIG*** <br>
```shell
tar xvf pig-[version].tar.gz
```
**Step 4 :-** ***Move to your desired location. Preferably Hadoop Home***
```shell
cd pig-[version]
sudo mv pig-[version]/* /$HADOOP_HOME
```
**Step 5 :-** ***Adding envrionment variables.***
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/home/noobwithskills/HADOOP_HOME/pig-[version]]/bin
export PIG_HOME=/home/noobwithskills/HADOOP_HOME/pig-[version]]/
export PIG_CLASSPATH=$HADOOP_HOME/conf
```
**Step 6 :-** ***Update bashrc.***
```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```
**Step 7 :-** ***Check for pig-installation***
```shell
pig -version
```
**NOTE :** If you don't see a pig-version, try troubleshooting or comment down below .

**Step 8 :-** ***Starting Apache Pig***
* In Local Mode : Pig can acces your local filesystem files only.
```shell
pig -x local
```
* In Cluster Mode : Pig can acces HDFS files.
```shell
pig
```
* If all goes well you should see `grunt > ` on your CLI.
